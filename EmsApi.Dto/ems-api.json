Since these options are more complex and can leave\r\n            \t\tsample locations with no value (i.e. the analytic isn't sampled at that location) or DNE values where the sample\r\n            \t\t\"does not exist\" you can use the \"offsetType\" in conjunction with the \"unsampledDataMode\", the \"unsampledValue\",\r\n            \t\tand/or the \"doesNotExistValue\" options.
